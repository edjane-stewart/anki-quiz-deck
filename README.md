# anki-quiz-deck
anki quiz-deck template

This deck contains several cards designed to support questions with:
<ul>
<li> Multi choice single answer</li>
<li> Multi choice multiple answers</li>
<li> True or false answer</li>
<li> Order the sequence/steps</li>
<li> Match column 1 to column 2</li>
</ul>
This deck will work both on Anki desktop and Anki Android. It will not work on AnkiWeb (can't study using AnkiWeb). The best way to use the deck between desktop and android is to use AnkiWeb to upload from desktop and dowload to mobile. 

This deck was tested with Anki desktop (Windows / MAC) and AnkiDroid. However, it was not tested with iPad mobile.
