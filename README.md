# anki-quiz-deck
anki quiz-deck template

This deck contains several cards designed to support questions with:
<ul>
<li> Randomized multi-choice single answer</li>
<li> Randomized Multi-choice multiple answers</li>
<li> True or false answer</li>
<li> Reorder the randomized list/sequence/steps</li>
<li> Match randomized items in column 1 to column 2</li>
</ul>
<p>All the quiz cards will shuffle the choices (but the choices stay on the same position on the front and back for each view), giving a little variety so students don't memorize the choice order instead of the answer.</p>

<p>When using AnkiDroid, using the whiteboard feature allows the student to mark the answer and compare to the correct answer displayed on the back. Gives it a little interactivity.</p>

<p>This deck will work both on Anki desktop and Anki Android. It will not work on AnkiWeb (can't study using AnkiWeb). The best way to use the deck between desktop and android is to use AnkiWeb to upload from desktop and download to mobile. </p>

<p>This deck was tested with Anki desktop (Windows / MAC) and AnkiDroid. However, it was not tested with AnkiMobile (for iPAD).</p>

<p>Many thanks to RunasSudo @ https://www.yingtongli.me/blog/2015/03/15/random-question-generator-on-anki-using.html for sharing his code to persist data between front and back of an Anki card and for PaperClipBadger @ https://gist.github.com/PaperclipBadger/af3c3262ef1142804f9e9f18ae472c7e for sharing persist method rearranging and allowing me to make the card templates easier to use.</p>
